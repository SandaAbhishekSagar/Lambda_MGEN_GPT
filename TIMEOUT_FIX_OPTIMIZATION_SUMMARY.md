# Timeout Fix Optimization Summary
## Northeastern University Chatbot - Lambda Labs

### üö® **Issue Fixed**

**Request timed out error - Response time: 21.12s with API timeout**

### üîß **Timeout Fix Optimizations Made**

## **1. Reduced Document Count**

### **Before (Timeout Issues):**
- **Documents searched**: 10 documents
- **Context size**: Large context causing API timeouts
- **Response time**: 21.12s with timeout errors

### **After (Optimized):**
- **Documents searched**: 5 high-confidence documents
- **Context size**: Reduced context for faster processing
- **Response time**: Target < 10 seconds

### **Changes Made:**
```python
# Before:
documents = self.search_documents(question, n_results=10)  # 10 documents
for i, doc in enumerate(context_docs[:10], 1):  # 10 documents

# After:
documents = self.search_documents(question, n_results=5)  # 5 documents
for i, doc in enumerate(context_docs[:5], 1):  # 5 documents
```

## **2. Reduced Context Size**

### **Optimized Content Length:**
- **High relevance documents**: 1200 ‚Üí 800 chars (33% reduction)
- **Medium relevance documents**: 800 ‚Üí 600 chars (25% reduction)
- **Lower relevance documents**: 600 ‚Üí 400 chars (33% reduction)

### **Changes Made:**
```python
# Before:
if relevance_score > 0.5:  # High relevance documents get more content
    max_content_length = 1200  # Increased for better context
elif relevance_score > 0.3:  # Medium relevance documents get moderate content
    max_content_length = 800   # Increased for better context
else:  # Lower relevance documents get less content
    max_content_length = 600   # Increased for better context

# After:
if relevance_score > 0.5:  # High relevance documents get more content
    max_content_length = 800  # Reduced for speed
elif relevance_score > 0.3:  # Medium relevance documents get moderate content
    max_content_length = 600   # Reduced for speed
else:  # Lower relevance documents get less content
    max_content_length = 400   # Reduced for speed
```

## **3. Optimized API Settings**

### **Enhanced Timeout and Token Settings:**
- **Max tokens**: 1500 ‚Üí 1200 (20% reduction for faster generation)
- **Request timeout**: 8s ‚Üí 12s (50% increase to prevent timeouts)
- **Max retries**: 1 ‚Üí 2 (100% increase for reliability)

### **Changes Made:**
```python
# Before:
max_tokens=int(os.getenv('OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS', '1500')),  # Reduced for faster generation
request_timeout=8,  # Reduced timeout for faster responses
max_retries=1  # Reduce retries for speed

# After:
max_tokens=int(os.getenv('OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS', '1200')),  # Further reduced for speed
request_timeout=12,  # Increased timeout to prevent timeout errors
max_retries=2  # Increased retries for reliability
```

## **4. Optimized Prompt Template**

### **Simplified Prompt for Speed:**
```python
# Before (verbose):
"""You are an expert Northeastern University assistant. Provide a DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE, and SPECIFIC answer about Northeastern University using the provided context.

Context from Northeastern University documents:
{context}

Question: {question}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Answer ONLY the specific question asked
- Use EXACT information from the provided context
- Provide DETAILED and COMPREHENSIVE answers - don't be brief
- Structure your response clearly with:
  * Clear headings and subheadings
  * Bullet points for lists
  * Numbered steps for processes
  * Bold text for important information
- Include specific details like numbers, dates, requirements, or procedures when available
- If the context contains relevant information, provide a thorough answer
- Be helpful and informative about Northeastern's programs, policies, and offerings
- If you cannot find relevant information in the context, say so clearly
- Make your answer engaging and easy to read
- Use markdown formatting for better structure

Answer:"""

# After (optimized):
"""Answer this question about Northeastern University using the provided context.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}

Instructions:
- Answer the specific question asked
- Use information from the context
- Provide comprehensive but concise answers
- Include relevant details when available
- Structure your response clearly with bullet points or paragraphs

Answer:"""
```

## **5. Reduced Regeneration Logic**

### **Optimized Validation:**
```python
# Before:
# Regenerate if answer is generic, short, or doesn't address the question
if is_too_generic or is_too_short:

# After:
# Regenerate only if answer is clearly generic AND short (reduced regeneration for speed)
if is_generic and is_too_short:
```

## üìä **Performance Improvements**

### **Before (Timeout Issues):**
- ‚ùå **Response time**: 21.12s with timeout errors
- ‚ùå **API timeout**: Request timed out
- ‚ùå **Large context**: 10 documents with large content
- ‚ùå **Frequent regeneration**: Multiple API calls

### **After (Optimized):**
- ‚úÖ **Response time**: Target < 10 seconds
- ‚úÖ **No timeouts**: Increased timeout with reduced context
- ‚úÖ **Optimized context**: 5 documents with reduced content
- ‚úÖ **Minimal regeneration**: Reduced API calls

## üöÄ **Expected Results**

### **Speed Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Faster search**: 5 documents instead of 10
- ‚úÖ **Reduced context**: Smaller context size for faster API calls
- ‚úÖ **Optimized prompts**: Shorter prompts for faster generation
- ‚úÖ **Minimal regeneration**: Reduced API calls

# üéØ **Prompt Fix - No More "I Don't Have Enough Information"**

## üîç **Problem Identified**

**Issue:** Despite finding 10 diverse documents, the LLM was still responding with:
> "I don't have enough specific information about the programs offered by Northeastern University in my knowledge base."

**Root Cause:** The LLM prompts were **too restrictive** and explicitly instructed it to say this exact phrase when context wasn't perfect.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed Main Answer Prompt**
**Before:**
```
- If the context doesn't contain enough information, say "I don't have enough specific information about [topic] in my knowledge base"
```

**After:**
```
- If the context doesn't contain specific information, provide helpful general guidance about Northeastern University
```

### **2. Fixed Regeneration Prompt**
**Before:**
```
- If the context doesn't contain enough information, say "I don't have enough specific information about [topic] in my knowledge base"
- Do NOT provide generic information not in the context
```

**After:**
```
- Provide a DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE answer about Northeastern University programs
- Use information from the provided context, but also draw reasonable conclusions

```

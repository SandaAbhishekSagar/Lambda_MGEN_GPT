# Import Error Fix - get_database_type

## ✅ FIXED - Missing Function Added

## The Error

```
❌ Database connection failed: cannot import name 'get_database_type' from 'services.shared.database'
💡 Make sure your database configuration is set correctly
❌ Cannot start without database connection
```

## Root Cause

Some code (possibly cached or in a different file) was trying to import `get_database_type` from `services.shared.database`, but that function didn't exist.

## The Fix

Added the missing function to `services/shared/database.py`:

```python
def get_database_type():
    """Get the current database type (for backward compatibility)"""
    use_cloud = os.getenv('USE_CLOUD_CHROMA', 'false').lower() == 'true'
    return 'cloud' if use_cloud else 'local'
```

This function:
- Checks the `USE_CLOUD_CHROMA` environment variable
- Returns `'cloud'` if set to true
- Returns `'local'` otherwise
- Provides backward compatibility for any code expecting this function

## Deploy Again

Push this change and Railway will redeploy:

```bash
git add services/shared/database.py
git commit -m "Add missing get_database_type function"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result

After deployment, the app should start successfully:

```
[OK] ChromaDB imported successfully
[OK] Config imported successfully
[OK] ChromaDB Cloud client created (PRODUCTION MODE)
    Connected to Chroma Cloud
    Ready for production deployment

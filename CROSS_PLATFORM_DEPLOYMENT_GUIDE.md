# Cross-Platform Deployment Guide
## Northeastern University Chatbot - Lambda Labs

### 🎯 **Your Concern is Valid**

You're absolutely right! When hosting on Lambda Labs, people will access your chatbot through a web interface from any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile devices). The HuggingFace Hub compatibility issue needs to be fixed in the deployment script so it works automatically for everyone, regardless of their OS.

## ✅ **Solution: Automatic Fix in Deployment Script**

I've updated the `deploy_lambda_labs_optimized.sh` script to automatically fix the HuggingFace Hub compatibility issue during deployment. This ensures:

- ✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works for all users regardless of their OS
- ✅ **Automatic Fix**: No manual intervention required
- ✅ **Verification**: Tests the fix to ensure it works
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Handles the issue before users encounter it

## 🔧 **What's Fixed in the Deployment Script**

### **1. HuggingFace Hub Compatibility Fix**
The deployment script now automatically:
- Uninstalls problematic packages
- Installs compatible versions:
  - `huggingface-hub==0.19.4`
  - `transformers==4.35.2`
  - `sentence-transformers==2.2.2`
- Verifies the fix works

### **2. Requirements File Updated**
The `requirements_lambda_optimized.txt` now includes the correct versions from the start:
```
huggingface-hub==0.19.4
transformers==4.35.2
sentence-transformers==2.2.2
```

### **3. Automatic Verification**
The deployment script tests the fix to ensure it works before completing.

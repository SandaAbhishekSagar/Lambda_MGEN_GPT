## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The deployment is failing due to an **IndentationError** in `koyeb_gpu_handler.py` at line 369:

```
File "/app/koyeb_gpu_handler.py", line 369
    try:
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

## ✅ **Good News**

- **GPU is working perfectly** ✅
- **A100-SXM4-80GB detected** ✅

- **Image download completed** ✅
- **Only syntax error preventing startup** ⚠️

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### **Problem**
```python
@app.get("/performance")
async def performance_endpoint():
    """Performance monitoring endpoint"""
        try:  # ❌ Extra indentation here
```

### **Solution**
```python
@app.get("/performance")
async def performance_endpoint():
    """Performance monitoring endpoint"""
    try:  # ✅ Fixed indentation
```

## 🚀 **What This Fixes**

- ✅ **IndentationError resolved** - Python syntax fixed
- ✅ **GPU detection working** - A100 detected correctly
- ✅ **Memory allocation working** - 85GB available
- ✅ **Application startup** - Should start successfully now

## 📊 **Expected Results**

After redeployment:
- ✅ **Successful startup** - No more IndentationError
- ✅ **GPU acceleration** - A100 with 85GB memory
- ✅ **5-10 second responses** - GPU-optimized processing
- ✅ **Health checks pass** - Instance stays running

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Push the fixed file** to your repository
2. **Redeploy on Koyeb** - should start successfully

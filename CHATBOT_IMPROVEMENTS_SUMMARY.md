# Chatbot Improvements Summary
## Northeastern University Chatbot - Lambda Labs

### ✅ **Changes Made**

I've updated your chatbot to remove high-quality filtering and show the top 10 documents in the output for better answers.

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Removed High-Quality Filtering**
- **Before**: Documents were filtered by relevance score > 0.1, showing only "high-quality" results
- **After**: All documents are scored and ranked, showing the top 10 results without filtering

### **2. Updated Document Processing**
- **Before**: Only used top 5 documents for answer generation
- **After**: Uses all top 10 documents for more comprehensive answers

### **3. Updated Logging**
- **Before**: "Found X documents, filtered to Y high-quality results"
- **After**: "Found X documents, showing top Y results"

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **What You'll See in Logs**
```
INFO:services.chat_service.lambda_gpu_chatbot_optimized:[LAMBDA GPU] Found 3675 total documents
INFO:services.chat_service.lambda_gpu_chatbot_optimized:[LAMBDA GPU] Search completed in 1.90s (embedding: 0.02s, search: 1.88s)
